# Basic

This Repository is a basic log keeping for all the code written and will be written during the journey of "Mastering C/C++"
All these files are different codes in the C++ program language
They have been complied and tested from VS code editor
The commpiler used for this is the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler and debugger 
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc

I will try and separate the different chapters/Modules in different branches, also provide a reference to all the resources I refferred to during this journey.
Hope one day this helps a fellow programmer who is trying to navigate through the sea of information.
